Course Open Source Energy System Modelling : Homework 3

Here are my 5 notebooks. There are 2 "unchanged" ones (the baseline and the emissions_bound) to compare the results. And then 3 news ones. The idea is to start with:

1: "westeros_LEDS_baseline.ipynb", then go to 
2: "westeros_emissions_bounds_LEDs.ipynb" (or check with the unchanged notebooks if wanted), then 
3: "westeros_LEDS_diffusion_baseline.ipynb"
4: run "westeros_emissions_bounds_LEDs.ipynb" again to see the difference with a diffusion rate added. 

Informations are given inside about what I tried to do.
